# Battleships Project
A project that I made during my first year at University.

Battleships is a simple game of strategy, where you try to guess the positions of the enemy ship. Ships vary in size, as small as 3 positions long and as big as 5 positions long. Ships are generated randomly and have random orientations, leaving you having to guess where the ships could be.

This code consists of the following functions:
- PrintArray
- InitialiseMap
- AddRandomShip
- CountValues
- TopLeftPosition
- IsShipValid
- InitialiseRandomMap
- FireShot
- CheckGameOver

The game has 3 game modes:
- Human vs Human
- Human vs Bot
- Bot vs Bot
